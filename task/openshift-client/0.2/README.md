## OpenShift Client Task

[OpenShift](http://www.openshift.com) is a Kubernetes distribution from Red Hat which provides `oc`, the [OpenShift CLI](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/cli_reference/getting-started-cli.html) that complements `kubectl` for simplifying deployment and configuration applications on OpenShift.

Openshift-client runs commands against the cluster provided by the user via optional workspace and if not provided then it will take the cluster on which the `Task` is running.

## Changelog

- Use `workspaces` instead of `PipelineResources`.
- Add support for kubeconfig which can be provided via `workspaces`.
- Added samples and improved the README.
- Removed `ARGS` params.

## Install the Task

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tektoncd/catalog/main/task/openshift-client/0.2/openshift-client.yaml
```

## Parameters

- **SCRIPT:** script of oc commands to execute e.g. `oc get pod $1 -0 yaml` This will take the first value of ARGS as pod name (_default_: `oc help`)

- **VERSION:** The OpenShift version to use (_default_: `4.7`)

## Workspaces

The `Task` uses 2 optional workspaces:

- **manifest-dir**: The workspace which contains kubernetes manifests which we want to apply on the cluster.

- **kubeconfig-dir**: The workspace which contains the `kubeconfig` file if in case we want to run the `oc` command on another cluster.

## ServiceAccount

If you don't specify a service account to be used for running the `TaskRun` or `PipelineRun`, the `default` [service account](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/#use-the-default-service-account-to-access-the-api-server). OpenShift by default does not allow the default service account to modify objects in the namespace. Therefore you should either explicitly grant permission to the default service account (by creating rolebindings) or [create a new service account with sufficient privileges](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#service-account-permissions) and specify it on the [`TaskRun`](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/main/docs/taskruns.md#service-account) or [`PipelineRun`](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/main/docs/pipelineruns.md#service-account).

You can do the former via `oc` and running the following command, replacing `<namespace>` with your target namespace:

```
oc policy add-role-to-user edit -z default -n <namespace>
```

## Usage

We can refer to the following [sample](./samples/run-with-workspace.yaml) of how to use this task.
